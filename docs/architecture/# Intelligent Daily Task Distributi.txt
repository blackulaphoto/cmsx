**Your Reality:** 20 clients with complex, multi-step processes that need intelligent sequencing and daily distribution.

**The Intelligence:** System breaks down complex cases into daily bite-sized actions and distributes across your week so everyone gets attention.

## 🔧 **Intelligent Process Templates**

### **Disability Claim Process (4-6 weeks)**
```python
disability_process = {
    "week_1": [
        "Get state ID/documents",
        "Request medical records (3-5 providers)",
        "Contact previous doctors"
    ],
    "week_2": [
        "Follow up on pending records", 
        "Complete disability application",

        "Follow up on disability status",
        "Prepare for appeal if needed"
    ]
}
```

### **Housing Search Process (1-3 weeks)**
```python
housing_process = {
    "urgent": [  # Client leaving soon
        "TODAY: Call 5 emergency housing options",
        "TODAY: Complete 3 applications", 
        "Tomorrow: Follow up with landlords"
    ],
    "standard": [  # Normal timeline
        "Week 1: Research options, gather documents",
        "Week 2: Applications and viewings",
        "Week 3: Decision and move-in prep"
    ]
}
```

        "Resume creation/update",
        "Job search training",
        "Interview preparation"
    ],
    "week_2": [
        "Apply to 10+ positions",
        "Follow up on applications", 
        "Schedule interviews"
    ]
}
```

## 🎯 **Smart Task Distribution Algorithm**

### **Daily Task Budget**
```python
daily_capacity = {
    "phone_calls": 8,        # Max calls per day
    "appointments": 3,       # Max in-person meetings  
    "paperwork": 5,          # Max forms/applications
    "follow_ups": 10,        # Quick check-ins
    "crisis_time": 2         # Emergency buffer
}
```

### **Intelligent Prioritization**
```python
def prioritize_daily_tasks(clients, date):
    priorities = []
    
    for client in clients:
        # URGENT: Leaving soon or crisis
        if client.days_until_discharge <= 7:
            priorities.append({
                "client": client.name,
                "task": get_urgent_task(client),
                "priority": "URGENT",
                "time_needed": estimate_time(task)
            })
        
        # HIGH: New admissions needing setup
        elif client.days_in_program <= 7:
            priorities.append({
                "client": client.name, 
                "task": get_intake_task(client),
                "priority": "HIGH",
                "time_needed": estimate_time(task)
            })
        
        # MEDIUM: Ongoing process steps
        elif has_active_process(client):
            task = get_next_process_step(client)
            priorities.append({
                "client": client.name,
                "task": task,
                "priority": "MEDIUM", 
                "time_needed": estimate_time(task)
            })
    
    return distribute_across_week(priorities)
```

### **Weekly Distribution Logic**
```python
def distribute_across_week(tasks):
    weekly_plan = {
        "monday": [],
        "tuesday": [], 
        "wednesday": [],
        "thursday": [],
        "friday": []
    }
    
    # Distribute so each day has manageable workload
    for day in weekly_plan:
        daily_tasks = []
        time_budget = 6 * 60  # 6 hours in minutes
        
        # Add urgent tasks first
        urgent_tasks = get_urgent_for_day(day)
        daily_tasks.extend(urgent_tasks)
        time_budget -= sum(task.time_needed for task in urgent_tasks)
        
        # Fill remaining time with medium priority
        medium_tasks = get_medium_priority()
        for task in medium_tasks:
            if time_budget >= task.time_needed:
                daily_tasks.append(task)
                time_budget -= task.time_needed
        
        weekly_plan[day] = daily_tasks
    
    return weekly_plan
```

    # Get all clients and their active processes
    clients = get_case_manager_clients(case_manager_id)
    active_processes = get_active_processes(clients)
    
    # Run distribution algorithm
    weekly_plan = smart_distributor.generate_weekly_plan(
        clients=clients,

@app.route('/api/process/start', methods=['POST'])
def start_client_process():
    """Start a new process for a client (disability, housing, etc.)"""
    
    client_id = request.json['client_id']
    process_type = request.json['process_type']  # "disability_claim"
    timeline_weeks = request.json.get('timeline_weeks', 4)
    
    # Create process and distribute tasks across timeline
    process_id = create_client_process(client_id, process_type, timeline_weeks)
