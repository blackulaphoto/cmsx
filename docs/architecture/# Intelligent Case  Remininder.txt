# Intelligent Case Management Reminder System

## 🧠 **The Core Problem You're Solving**

**Reality:** Managing 20+ clients means tracking 100+ deadlines, tasks, and timelines simultaneously - impossible to keep in your head.

**Solution:** An intelligent reminder system that thinks like a case manager and automatically surfaces what needs attention when.

## 🎯 **Smart Reminder Categories**

### **1. Time-Based Client Contact Reminders**
**The Algorithm:**
```
Last Contact + Client Risk Level + Program Requirements = Reminder Frequency

High Risk Client: Check-in every 2-3 days
Medium Risk: Check-in every 5-7 days  
Low Risk: Check-in every 10-14 days
Crisis/Emergency: Daily until stabilized
```

**Example Alerts:**
- ⚠️ "Maria Garcia - 5 days since last contact (High Risk - check-in overdue)"
- ✅ "John Smith - Saw 2 days ago (on schedule, next check-in Friday)"
- 🔥 "Robert Jones - 8 days since contact (URGENT - immediate follow-up needed)"

### **2. Program Timeline Intelligence**
**Track Key Dates:**
```
Admission Date → Discharge Date = Program Length
Program Midpoint = Start housing search
75% Mark = Intensive discharge planning
2 Weeks Before Discharge = Final preparations
```

**Smart Milestones:**
- 📅 "Client XYZ admitted 45 days ago (90-day program) → START HOUSING SEARCH NOW"
- ⏰ "Client ABC discharge in 14 days → URGENT: Finalize housing/benefits"
- 📍 "Client DEF at program midpoint → Begin long-term planning"

### **3. Task-Driven Reminders**
**Intelligent Task Tracking:**
```
Disability Claim Started → Follow up in 30 days
Housing Application Submitted → Check status in 7 days
Court Date Scheduled → Prepare documents 3 days prior
Benefits Interview → Confirm 24 hours before
```

**Context-Aware Alerts:**
- 💼 "Disability claim for John (started 28 days ago) - follow-up due in 2 days"
- 🏠 "Housing application for Sarah - status check needed (submitted 6 days ago)"
- ⚖️ "Mike's court date tomorrow - verify he has transportation & documents"

```python
class IntelligentReminderEngine:
    def calculate_contact_urgency(self, client):
        """Calculate when client contact is needed"""
        days_since_contact = self.get_days_since_contact(client.id)
        risk_multiplier = self.get_risk_multiplier(client.risk_level)
        program_stage = self.get_program_stage(client)
        
        urgency_score = days_since_contact * risk_multiplier * program_stage
        return self.categorize_urgency(urgency_score)
    
    def generate_timeline_reminders(self, client):
        """Create milestone-based reminders"""
        program_length = self.get_program_length(client)
        days_in_program = self.get_days_in_program(client)
        
        # Auto-generate reminders based on program stage
        if days_in_program >= program_length * 0.5:
            self.create_reminder("Start housing search", client.id)
        
        if days_in_program >= program_length * 0.75:
            self.create_reminder("Intensive discharge planning", client.id)
```
