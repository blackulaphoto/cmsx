2️⃣ Data Model & Backend Architecture (Tech‑Ready)
A. Data Layers & Entities

    Case Entity – unique client case ID, client profile, jurisdiction (state), offense date(s), eligibility status, process stage.

    EligibilityRuleSet – store logic per jurisdiction: wait‑period, eligible offense types, sealing vs expungement rules.

    DocumentTemplate – variables for forms per court type.

    Task Schedule – associated to cases: “draft petition”, “file court packet”, “hearing hearing date”, with due dates calculated via rule engine.

    PaymentRecord – records invoice, payment method, tier selection, status.

B. Workflow Engine

    Orchestrates guided intake → eligibility logic → doc generation → attorney review or DIY submission → tracking.

    Permissions to escalate or hand off between DIY/self‑service or concierge team members.

    Event triggers: deadline changes, clients flagged, or missing docs.

C. API & Chat Interface (“Wilma”)

    Chat interface (web, SMS, voice) triggers API calls to intake Q&A; routes responses into case database; runs rules engine for eligibility.

    Should support multi‑modality connection: webhook integration with Twilio or voice systems.

D. Document Generation

    Use template engine (e.g. Docassemble, Formstack, or your own) that merges client data into court‑ready PDFs, auto‑naming and versioning.

    Store in secure, encrypted storage and track changes.

E. Reminder & Notification System

    Cron/jobby schedulers trigger reminders: upcoming tasks, missing info, filing deadlines.

    Send via email/SMS to client or internal case manager.

F. Client Portal / Dashboard

    Web UI where client logs in, sees status (“Eligibility: eligible”, “Petition drafted”, “Filed on mm/dd/yyyy”), can view docs, invoices, chat.

    Mirror tasks and messages, plus two‑way texting log (like MyCase) for engagement tracking

3️⃣ Suggested UI Flow for the Expungement Section

    Client Intake Tab (placeholder) → re-skin to Expungement Intake: personal data + offense info + jurisdiction.

    Eligibility Wizard button: launches the guided Q&A chat module, updates case eligibility field.

    Document Generation Button: available when eligible, triggers auto-population of correct forms.

    Task Timeline / Kanban Board: visualize “To-Do”, “Drafting”, “Filed”, “Approved” statuses for each petition request.

    Communications Panel: embed SMS/email/chat threads, document upload.

    Billing Section: show service tiers, accepted payments, status and invoices.

    Court Tracking Section: after filing, track status updates until final approval.

4️⃣ Smart Enhancements to Build Momentum 🚀
